## Morse Code generator

###Phase 1:
This was a 20 minute exercise. Create a simple piece of code that takes in a string of text and converts it to an output of Morse Code.

I used a hash structure to store the morse code relative the the english alphabet.

Program is case insensitive due to `.downcase` method being called on the input.
