## Loud Bob Ross

This simple little piece of code allows a user to take in a collection of quotes, represented as strings on their own lines, and produce a new text file where those quotes are shown in an ALL UPPERCASE version of the original file.
In this folder you will see examples of Bob Ross quotes that have gone from being soft, timid and powerful to LOUD and very "un-Rossy".
This code makes use of the following Ruby tools:
* ARGV
* File IO
